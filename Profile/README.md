### PowerShell Profile Examples

---

My PowerShell Profile and include files - Use at your own risk.  
Some features:  

- Detect VPN and set/unset the system proxies and correct info for Vagrant and git.
- A config block for the PSColor module thta will colorize directory listings.
- Misc functions/aliases to create a few "Linux like" CLI tools.
- Some Azure cli aliases to authenticate to a tenant and start/stop VMs.
- Anything else handy I think of.
